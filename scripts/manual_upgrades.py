# NOTE: This is to be used to manually upgrade contracts when having control over
# the governance key and no CF network has been deployed yet. To be used in mainnet
# if there is a need to upgrade a contract before the Vault has any funds. The
# StakeManager would require moving the genesis Stake between Vaults.

# Steps:

# 1. Deploy the new contracts using deploy_upgraded_contracts.py. Either deploy
#    a new vault (deploy_vault) or a new stakeManager (deploy_stakeManager) or both
#    (deploy_vault_stakemanager).

# 2. Assuming no CF network has been deployed yet and that the current AggKey is a
#    dummy one, we can wait _AGG_KEY_TIMEOUT (2 days) to set a known AggKey. This
#    will be a single schnorr key that is known. This should be done as shown in
#    update_agg_key. However, this should be done via multisig so this is just a
#    mockup of what should be done.

# 3. Input the known private key in consts.py as AGG_PRIV_HEX_1.

# 4. If we are upgrading a StakeManager contract, we need to register a claim to
#    move all the FLIP to the new StakeManager. An EMPTY vault doesn't require
#    any extra step but a Vault with funds require a transfer of tokens to the
#    new vault. For this initial upgrade, this should not be needed.

# 5. If we have registered a claim, wait for CLAIM_DELAY and execute it via
#    execute_claim. This will move all the FLIP to the new StakeManager.

# 6. Run whitelist_new_vault with any account. This will sign a message with the
#    AggKey updating the whitelist with the new contracts. At the same time it will
#    dewhitelist the old ones.


# NOTE: This will fail if two days haven't passed since deployment or since
# last time a signature was verified. It will also fail if the DEPLOYER is not
# the governance key. If the govKey is a multisig it this will fail.
