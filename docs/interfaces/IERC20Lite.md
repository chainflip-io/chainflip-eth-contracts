# `IERC20Lite`

  The interface for functions ERC20Lite implements. This is intended to
          be used only in the Deposit contract.

     Any change in this contract, including comments, will affect the final
          bytecode and therefore will affect the create2 derived addresses.
          Do NOT modify unless the consequences of doing so are fully understood.
