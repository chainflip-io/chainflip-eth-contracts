Receive is not being executed on the deposit  contract. We need to use "function() external payable"
However, when fetching the event gets emitted in the vault  with receive. Why?
Seems like we can't use receive/fallback as wallet transfers won't trigger it.

Also, the fetch native seems to get emitted with a crazy amnount number. Why?
Seems to be an edge case when the value is zero in a call: recipient.call{value: 0}("");

If we move to selfdestruct/fetch deposit channels we can just chekc that when we fetch.
However, the problem becomes for Vault Swaps. How can we solve that?

Vault swap with some energy consumed by the deployer.

We can use thecontract's ennergy limit to limit the amount of energy that can be consumed per transaction from the deployer's account. However,
the max will be some batch fetch of multiple fetches, which is much greater than a grief/spam Vault swaps.
