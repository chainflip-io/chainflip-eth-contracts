/**
* @title    StakeManager contract
* @notice   Manages the staking of FLIP. Validators on the FLIP state chain
*           basically have full control of FLIP leaving the contract. Auction
*           logic for validator slots is not handled in this contract - bidders
*           just send their bid to this contract via `stake` with their FLIP state chain
*           nodeID, the ChainFlip Engine witnesses the bids, takes the top n bids,
*           assigns them to slots, then signs/calls `claim` to refund everyone else.
*
*           This contract also handles the minting of FLIP after the initial supply
*           is minted during FLIP's creation. Every new block after the contract is created is
*           able to mint `_emissionPerBlock` amount of FLIP. This is FLIP that's meant to
*           be rewarded to validators for their service. If none of them end up being naughty
*           boys or girls, then their proportion of that newly minted reward will be rewarded
*           to them based on their proportion of the total stake when they `claim` - though the logic of
*           assigning rewards is handled by the ChainFlip Engine via aggKey and this contract just blindly
*           trusts its judgement. There is an intentional limit on the power to mint, which is
*           why there's an emission rate controlled within the contract, so that a compromised
*           aggKey can't mint infinite tokens - the most that can be minted is any outstanding
*           emission of FLIP and the most that can be stolen is the FLIP balance of this contract,
*           which is the total staked (or bidded during auctions) + total emitted from rewards.
*           However, a compromised govKey could change the emission rate and therefore mint
*           infinite tokens.
