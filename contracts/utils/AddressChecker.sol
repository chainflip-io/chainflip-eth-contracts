/**
 * @title    Address Checker contract
 * @notice   Gets data from multiple addresses in single function calls.
 *           It can be used to check balances and to check whether there is bytecode
 *           (contract deployed) for multiple addresses. This is useful in order to avoid
 *           issuing a separate call for each address, which is very innefficient.
 * @dev      This contract only contains view functions that doesn't spend gas. However, some RPC
 *           providers put a cap on the amount of gas that the transaction *would* consume to
 *           prevent spamming. As a rough refernece, a try using a free INFURA endpoint succesfully
 *           executes around 75k addresses for getNativeBalances but fails when requesting 100k.
 *           It's advised to split up such big lists to prevent failures.
